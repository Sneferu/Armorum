### Armorum

_The optimal minimal terminal_

# Purpose

Do you ever find yourself gravitating to dark mode?  Have you ever spent an hour working before realizing your mouse wasn't on?  Is your computer an overpowered gateway to the glorious ssh-scape of the net?  If you're the kind of person who groans when a program "won't work without a GUI", Armorum will feel like home.

Armorum is a set of tools and configuration files designed to beautify and streamline a terminal-centric existence.  It revolves around the holy trifecta of Tmux, Vim, and the Fish shell.  It consists of three principle parts: entry scripts, configuration, and tooling.  The entry scripts are those bash and tcsh rc's which set up a friendly environment, then drop into fish.  The configuration files set everything up with convenient key bindings and a uniform, clean aesthetic.  Finally, the tools are a set of scripts (primarily implemented as fish functions) designed to make life easier.  Armorum is constantly evolving, and the repetoir will only grow!

# Usage

Installing Armorum is as simple as entering the repo and running 'make install'.  That's it!  No compilations, no dreaded toolchain clownery - but beware.  Armorum is a selfish creature and will replace your bash/tcsh configuration in favor of fish.  In future versions, this behavior will be mitigated, but for now, it's best to have a backup.

Enjoy!
